# Features
## DONE:
- A new difficulty called Inferno.
- Because the diabloui.dll hasn't been reverse-engineered, I've decided to use a trick to replace hell difficulty with a new one, to do it, create a file named `enable_inferno` in your Diablo folder and choose "hell" difficulty in the difficulty selection menu. 
- Special items with 3 affixes can drop there. 
- The third affix will only drop if the item has a suffix and a prefix. Additional affix doesn't follow the regular prefix/suffix rules, which mean that combinations that weren't possible before can occur. 
- Full compatibility with vanilla diablo - you can move your character between Diablo and Infernity without any data loss! (Of course you won't see the third affix in normal diablo) 
- Running in town/dungeon 
- Highlighting enemies in combat 
- A config to enable or disable stuff
## TO DO:
- Level cap raised to 60.
- Penalty to resistances/AC on Inferno difficulty.
- Fixing possible overflows in monster AC/to hit/etc. on difficulties above normal.
- Remove/change permanent negative shrines and Black Death hp decrease (In general, things permanently damaging your character)

# Installing
[Click to download exe+config v1.03](https://github.com/qndel/Infernity/releases/download/v.1.03/Infernity.7z)
Unpack the Infernity.7z and put the files in your diablo folder.
Launch `Infernity.exe` in your Diablo folder to play. The following files from the original game patched to 1.09 need to be present: `DIABDAT.MPQ`, `DiabloUI.dll`, `SmackW32.dll`, `Standard.snp`, and `Storm.dll`.
Additionally, Strange Bytes' [DirectDraw patch](http://www.strangebytes.com/index.php/projects/1-diablo-1-windows-7-vista-patch) is recommended to help fix compatibility issues and run the game in windowed mode.
